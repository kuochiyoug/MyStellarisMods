 GER_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Stuka's design had several innovative features, including automatic pull-up dive brakes under both wings to ensure that the aircraft recovered from its attack dive even if the pilot blacked out from the high g-forces. Upon the leading edges of its faired main gear legs were mounted the "Jericho trumpet" wailing sirens, becoming the propaganda symbol of German air power and the blitzkrieg victories."
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Ar 81 lost the 1936 competition for a modern dive-bomber to the Junkers Ju 87; although the Arado plane was fastest entry and showed many good qualities, the Luftwaffe's head of procurement, Ernst Udet, was determined on a monoplane dive-bomber. The Ar 81 had better take-off and landing performance than the Ju 87, and the carrier designers felt it might serve better at sea than the Junkers aircraft."
 GER_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Hs 129, often referred to by its nickname, the Panzerknacker (tank cracker), was developed to a 1937 requirement for a twin-engine ground attack aircraft mounting at least two 20mm cannon and with heavy armor for the pilot and engines. Having two engines helped improve survivability as well in case one was knocked out by ground fire."
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "Several enhancements had to be made to adapt the Ju 87 to a carrier based aircraft. In addition to a more massive fuselage, storable wings and an arrestor hook, the landing gear could be dropped for emergency landings in the ocean. A quick fuel dump mechanism and two inflatable bags in each wing and a further two bags in the fuselage enabled the Ju 87 C to remain afloat for up to three days in calm seas."
 GER_CAS_equipment_3_desc:0 "The BV 237 was an unusual asymmetric design. The aircraft carried its single engine in a long boom that ended in the tail plane. The crew compartment was to its right, connected by a short central wing section. There were certain advantages to the asymmetric design, such as a superior pilot view and ease of construction and maintenance."
 GER_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Heinkel He 51 was the first fighter aircraft to be used by the Luftwaffe after its official formation in April 1935. It was a single-seat biplane, with an all-metal framework with fabric covering, and armed with two fixed forward firing machine guns mounted above the engine."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Heinkel He 60 was a sturdy single-engined twin-float biplane, designed in response to a Ministry of Transportation and Navy request for a seaworthy marine reconnaissance and shipboard aircraft, capable of being launched by catapult. As the programme of rebuilding Germany’s navy accelerated, the type was selected for service aboard German battlecruisers and cruisers."
 GER_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Bf 109 prototype first flew in September, 1935. Powered by a liquid cooled, twelve cylinder engine, it was a low wing, all metal construction monoplane, with flush rivets, leading edge slats, and retractable landing gear. Its single-seat cockpit had a fully enclosed canopy. While none of the developments were revolutionary in 1935, Messerschmitt first put them all together in the Bf 109."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Arado Ar 197 was a development of the Ar 68 fighter. Like other biplane fighters of the 1930s it had good manueverability and heavy armament, and its speed was only slightly less than the early versions of the Bf 109. It had good short-field performance which was considered vital for a carrier plane."
 GER_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The twin-row radial engine that powered most operational versions enabled the Fw 190 to lift larger loads than the Bf 109. While the Fw 190’s performance fell off at altitudes above 20,000 feet, limiting its effectiveness against high flying bombers, for low-level combat the Fw 190 was ideal. It was rugged, maneuverable, stable, and, with its two machine guns and four cannon, powerfully armed."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Bf 109 T was a modification of the Bf 109, with a larger wing, four catapult attachment points, a tail hook, and a strengthened landing gear. It was armed with two fuselage-mounted machine guns, with provisions for two machine guns or two cannon in the wings. The wings were not modified to be folding, but they could be detached from the fuselage for transport purposes."
 GER_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Ta 152 was a development of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. It was intended to be made in at least three versions — the Ta 152H Höhenjäger ("high-altitude fighter"), the Ta 152C designed for medium-altitude operations and ground-attack using a different engine and smaller wing, and the Ta 152E fighter-reconnaissance aircraft with the engine of the H model and the wing of the C model."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Originally a design for a carrier-based fighter, the BV 155 was ultimately adapted to a role of a high-altitude interceptor, powered by a twelve cylinder engine with an exhaust-driven turbo-charger. The turbo-charger was mounted behind the cockpit, fed air from a scoop under the fuselage. Compressed air was then fed forward to the engine in two tubes running on the outside of the plane."
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Bf 110 developed from a specification issued by the RLM in 1934, which called for an all-metal, twin-engine long-range multipurpose heavy figher. The Bf 110 was far superior to its rivals in providing the speed, range and firepower to meet its role requirements. Its forward-firing armament was lethal, and in concept, the speed and heavy armament of the aircraft would compensate for its limited maneuverability."
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Me 410 Hornisse was developed as a successor to the Me 110. It had a modified nose that was much shorter and located over the centre of gravity, an internal bomb-bay, an all-new wing designed for higher cruise speeds, with large airbrakes for dive bombing attacks, and a highly advanced remote-control defensive armament system that gave the gunner a far wider field of fire with very little drag."
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Pfeil's performance was much better than other twin-engine designs due to its unique "push-pull" layout and the much lower aerodynamic drag of the in-line alignment of the two engines. It was Germany's fastest piston-engined aircraft of World War II."
 GER_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Despite its high wing loading and lack of low-speed thrust, the Me 262 was quite maneuverable. The controls were light, effective, and perfectly harmonized. Me 262's clean design also meant that it held its speed in tight turns much better than conventional propeller-driven fighters, which was a great potential advantage in a dogfight."
 GER_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "For the 1110 project Messerschmitt designers packaged main fuselage components one behind the other, starting at the nose; armament, forward undercarriage, cockpit, fuel tanks and a turbojet engine. This made for a very compact, slim fuselage, with 40°-swept wing surfaces and an all-wheeled, retractable tricycle undercarriage."
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Heinkel He 59 was a large twin-engined biplane, resulting from a requirement for a torpedo bomber and reconnaissance aircraft able to operate with equal facility on wheeled landing gear or twin-floats. It had a quite old-fashioned appearance, mostly because her twin engines were carried in nacelles mounted between the wings."
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Fi 167 included a number of features designed to give it a short take-off and landing (STOL) capability. Both main wings had full-span automatic slots on their leading edge, while the lower wing had large trailing-edge flaps. Each of these features increased available lift at low speed and combined to produce an aircraft that could almost descend vertically."
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Dornier Do 217 was a scaled-up development of the Do 17. This versatile aircraft appeared with a variety of powerplants during its career between 1940 and 1944. It served in a number of groundbreaking roles, including nightfighter and anti-shipping guided-missile platform."
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Ju 87 E received modifications similar to the Ju 87 C, but was based on an improved variant of the Ju 87. The improvements included increased engine power and armour protection, an aerodynamically refined cockpit, and a new dual-barrel machine gun with an extremely high rate of fire in the rear defensive position. Bomb carrying ability was nearly quadrupled to 4,000 lb."
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Do 317 was originally Dornier's entry in the RLM's "Bomber B" program of 1939 and based broadly on the Do 217 with a pressurized cabin and more powerful engines. It was eventually developed into a Henschel 293A anti-ship guided missile carrier."
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc:0 "In September 1934 testing began of a much-modified Dornier Do 11 with stronger airframe, Junkers double-wing flaps and ailerons, and many other changes. To erase the bad reputation of its forebear this aircraft was redesignated Do 23. Although the rework corrected some problems, the Dornier Do 23 was overall not much better than its disappointing predecessor."
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The He 111 was largely based on the Heinkel He 70, a small commercial airliner that had entered Lufthansa service in 1934. Asked to produce a larger airliner Heinkel responded with a twin-engined version that shared the same elliptical wings and tail plane of the He 70. This design was examined by the RLM, which ordered Heinkel to produce a bomber version of the aircraft."
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Ju 88 airframe was structurally strong and had capacity for large fuel and bomb loads. Among the distinctive features of the Ju 88 were the compact crew compartment, purposely designed that way for crew morale, and the large single struts of the main landing gear. When retracted, the wheels turned 90 degrees and tucked into the engine nacelles."
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Junkers Ju 288 was one entry in the "Bomber B" competition of 1939, designed to provide the Luftwaffe with a long range high performance medium bomber. Historically the entire program and every aircraft designed for it was essentially doomed by the insistence on the use of two engines rather than four, as the promising engines then under development failed to live up to expectations."
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Dornier Do 19 was developed as part of the "Ural Bomber" program championed by Gen. Walther Wever who foresaw the need for long range strategic bombing capability. The Do 19 was a mid-wing cantilever design, and was mostly metal in construction. It had a rectangular-section fuselage and a tail unit with braced twin fins and rudders. It also had retractable landing gear, including the tailwheel."
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Externally, the He 177 appeared as a twin-engine aircraft as it looked fitted with two propeller systems and two engine nacelles. However, the He 177 was in fact fitted with four engines, two to each wing and engineered in coupled pairs, each pair driving a single propeller through a complex gearing mechanism."
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "Early on Heinkel proposed using four separate engines on the He 177, but the RLM was generally opposed to four engined bombers, and refused to support the project. Heinkel continued to work on the project regardless, under the designation He 177B, but initial test results were not promising. The problems were eventually solved by adopting a twin tail fin configuration."
 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The He 343 was based on the Arado Ar 234, the world's first operational jet-powered bomber. The enlarged fuselage had space for an internal bomb bay and for the double-braked main gear. The wings were unswept and mounted mid-fuselage, with four jet engines attached singly underneath. The nose was newly designed, and a crew of two sat in the pressurized cockpit."
 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Junkers EF 132 was the culmination of the Ju 287 design. The shoulder-mounted wings, with six jet engines buried in the wing roots, were swept back at a 35° angle. Thanks to the high placement of the wings, an unbroken bomb bay of 12 meters could be utilized in the center fuselage. A fully glazed, pressurized cockpit located in the fuselage nose held a crew of five."
 GER_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Ho XVIII utilized six turbojets, which were buried in the fuselage and exausted over the rear of the aircraft. They were fed by air intakes located in the wing's leading edge. To save weight the aircraft used a jettisonable landing gear for take-off and skid for landing. The Ho XVIII was built mainly of wood and held together with a special carbon based glue."
